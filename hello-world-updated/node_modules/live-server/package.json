Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.\n\nThere are two reasons for using this:\n\n1. AJAX requests don't work with the `file://` protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript.\n2. Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.\n\nIf you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something simpler, like the following Python-based one-liner:\n\n\tpython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.\n\n**Npm way**\n\n\tnpm install -g live-server\n\n**Manual way**\n\n\tgit clone https://github.com/tapio/live-server\n\tcd live-server\n\tnpm install # Local dependencies if you want to hack\n\tnpm install -g # Install globally\n\n\nUsage from command line\n-----------------------\n\nIssue the command `live-server` in your project's directory. Alternatively you can add the path to serve as a command line parameter.\n\nThis will automatically launch the default browser (you should have `index.html` present). When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.\n\nCommand line parameters:\n\n* `--port=NUMBER` - select port to use (can also be done with PORT environment variable)\n* `--host=ADDRESS` - select host address to bind to, default: 0.0.0.0 (\"any address\")\n* `--no-browser` - suppress automatic web browser launching\n* `--quiet` - suppress logging\n* `--open=PATH` - launch browser to PATH instead of server root\n* `--ignore=PATH` - comma-separated string of paths to ignore\n* `--entry-file=PATH` - serve this file in place of missing files (useful for single page apps)\n* `--wait=MILLISECONDS` - wait for all changes, before reloading\n* `--help | -h` - display terse usage hint and exit\n* `--version | -v` - display version and exit\n\nDefault options:\n\nIf a file `~/.live-server.json` exists it will be loaded and used as default options for live-server on the command line. See \"Usage from node\" for option names.\n\n\nUsage from node\n---------------\n\n```javascript\nvar liveServer = require(\"live-server\");\n\nvar params = {\n\tport: 8181, // Set the server port. Defaults to 8080.\n\thost: \"0.0.0.0\", // Set the address to bind to. Defaults to 0.0.0.0.\n\troot: \"/public\", // Set root directory that's being server. Defaults to cwd.\n\topen: false, // When false, it won't load your browser by default.\n\tignore: 'scss,my/templates', // comma-separated string for paths to ignore\n\tfile: \"index.html\", // When set, serve this file for every 404 (useful for single-page applications)\n\twait: 1000 // Waits for all changes, before reloading. Defaults to 0 sec.\n};\nliveServer.start(params);\n```\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nOpen your browser's console: there should be a message at the top stating that live reload is enabled. Note that you will need a browser that supports WebSockets. If there are errors, deal with them. If it's still not working, [file an issue](https://github.com/tapio/live-server/issues).\n\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThe server is a simple node app that serves the working directory and its subdirectories. It also watches the files for changes and when that happens, it sends a message through a web socket connection to the browser instructing it to reload. In order for the client side to support this, the server injects a small piece of JavaScript code to each requested html file. This script establishes the web socket connection and listens to the reload requests.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe welcome contributions!
